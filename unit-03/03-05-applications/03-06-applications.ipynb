    "1. do an automatic curve fit of *any mathematical function* to data and find the best-fit curve parameters.\n",
    "2. use the model to answer questions and make predictions.\n",
    "3. be wary of making predictions since the model may not fit data outside the range used for the model. (For example, a model based on \"past\" data may not fit \"future\" data.)\n",

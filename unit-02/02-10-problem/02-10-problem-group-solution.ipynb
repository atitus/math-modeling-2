    "Sports analytics is a fairly new field of study. The popular book *Moneyball* by Michael Lewis highlighted the emergence of this field and its role in assembling the highly successful and relatively inexpensive Oakland As baseball team in 2002. (It become a successful film as well.) In the NBA, the Houston Rockets relied on data analysis to play a very small lineup of three-point shooters who shot long, less probable three shots instead of shorter more probable two-point shots. The outcome was a higher scoring team on average, and the NBA game was changed forever. Today, NFL football coaches use probability calculations to go for two points (instead one one point) or go for a first down (instead of punting), often against traditional wisdom.\n",

If you hate sports, then choose a topic in business analytics where understanding probability changed the business and decision making.\n",

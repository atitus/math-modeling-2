(1) The practice assessment is typically longer than an actual assessment. (2) The actual assessment will have both an individual part and a group part, which you will solve with an assigned partner.**\n",

A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects.\"\n",

    "# Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "See Module 9.5 in *Introduction to Computational Science* by Shiflet and Shiflet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many physical processes are a result of an object traveling in a medium through random collisions with molecules or atoms in the medium. Examples include a pollen particle in a fluid, calcium traveling through a bone, or a photon generated in the interior of the sun traveling to the surface. One way to simulate this process is a *random walk*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. randomly select steps for the object.\n",
    "1. visualize the path of the object.\n",
    "1. calculate the distance traveled from its starting location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Ronald Ross (1857-1932) was a British medical doctor who received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work on malaria. He was not a mathematician by trade, but he was interested in calculating the distance of a mosquito-carried disease from a breeding pool. In September 1904, at the International Congress of Arts and Science in St. Louis, Ross gave a presentation on how to mathematically model the spread of mosquitoes from such a breeding pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing the topic, he says:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Suppose that a mosquito is born at a given point, and that during its life wanders about, to and fro, to left or to right, where it wills, in search of food or mating, over a country which is uniformly attractive to it. After a time, it will die. What are the probabilities that its dead body will be found at a given distance from its birthplace? That is really the problem which governs the whole of this great subject of the prophylaxis of malaria.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "He also says:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The answer depends upon the distance which a mosquito can traverse, not during a single flight, but during its whole life; and so upon certain laws of probability, which must govern its wanderings to and fro upon the face of the earth\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ross considered the mosquito's life to be divided into $n$ stages. During each stage, it travels a total distance $L$ in the air. He considered mosquitos traveling in all directions, but for mathematical simplicity he considered a single mosquito to travel along one axis only (i.e. one dimension). During each stage, the mosquito randomly decides *twice* to fly forward or backward a distance $L/2$, with equal probability 1/2 of flying forward or backward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ross did not give this process a name; however, today mathematicians and scientists call this a *one-dimensional random walk*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ross calculated the probability of finding a dead mosquito at a distance $L$, $2L$, $3L$, etc. for $n$ stages. As a specfic example, he considered 1024 mosquitos with $n=5$ stages. The expected number of mosquitos at each possible distance from the breeding pool is shown below.\n",
